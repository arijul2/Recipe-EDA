# Recipe-EDA
This is a project for DSC80 at UCSD where exploratory data analysis was performed on a recipes and ratings dataset.

## INTRODUCTION

Excess sugar consumption is a debilitating epidemic among developed nations.
One way to analyze such sugar consumption is looking at recipes online and their ratings, in relation to their sugar content.
We are trying to figure out if the recipes that are the subject of positive reviews have a higher or lower sugar content than that of negative reviews.
